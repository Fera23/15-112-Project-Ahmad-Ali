My project is an interactive game, bandersnatch-like game, where the user is able to reach different endings based on their in-game choices.
the game will have a starting menu with four buttons: Start button, information button, settings button and quit button.
Starting button starts the game. Information button gives user information on the controls, and some insight about the game.
Settings will have a library of sound tracks used, lighting options and an option for auto dialog, which speed could be altered.
The quit button closes the application.
If time allows a continue button might be added.

Inside the game, the user will have the option to do some choices by pressing one of two or three. While they can also  interact with specific interactable objects on the screen at times. With the inclusion of some puzzles, which if solved the user will gain some advantage to a specific ending.

By the chekpoint deadline, i expect to be done with the GUI, and a small demo of how the game should go. Either in the form of the full functioning game but minus the story, or a snippt of the story and the game. That
