# 15-112-Project-Ahmad-Ali
My project is a program that solves mazes (maze solver).
It takes a text file of a maze, and solves it in the quickest and best route.
The program has a GUI that has three buttons, first is an upload your own maze button. Second is a use one of our mazes button, third is a manual on how it works. 
The program will use backtracking, and go through each possible option before determining the correct way.
It will choose a full tree of choices, and then back track to the last choice not taken and take that tree.

The program will show the user on the GUI how it does it, by showing all the ways tried until reaching the correct one. The program will evolve into an image based (if time allows) and if so, will need an image processing library like OpenCV. But for now, no libraries are needed.

I will be done with the GUI and the set mazes by the checkpoint, hopefully.
